ice9 is the shell to start my program.

You can use my program like this: "ice9 test1.tm < bsort.9.txt".

The program accepts the first parameter as the output file name, which will be the generated tm code. 

If there is no parameter provided, it will use "generated.tm" as the default file name. 

The program output nothing when the input pass the parsing and output error messages when lexer or parser reports errors.
