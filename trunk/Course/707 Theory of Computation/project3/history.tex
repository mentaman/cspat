The concept of symbolic execution was introduced academically with descriptions of the Select system, proposed by Boyer et al~\cite{select}. In 1976, test data generation using symbolic execution was first proposed by James C. King~\cite{symbolic}. Around the same time, Clarke also did the work on this~\cite{test76}. Their pioneer works open the ways to automatic test data generation by using symbolic execution to do static analysis of code for path safety and prove theorems about code. However, these static ways faced the exponential state space explosion problem, which made it only practical for small programs. In recent years, Koushik Sen, whose paper on concolic testing~\cite{dart} won the ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished Paper Award at ESEC/FSE '05, proposed CUTE and DART tools, blossoming up the path-based automatic test data generation using symbolic execution. With the impressive progress of constraint solvers and concolic path-based testing~\cite{extenjpf,structural,mixed,exe,fuzz,pex}, it is possible to perform automatic path-based testing on large scale programs. Pex~\cite{pex}, a symbolic execution test generation tool for .NET proposed by Nikolai Tillmann, has been used to test .NET core libraries and found serious bugs. To alleviate the classic path explosion problem, many new techniques are also been proposed by Xie~\cite{fitness}, Godefroid~\cite{compositional} and so on.
