\begin{abstract}
Symbolic execution is a way to track programs symbolicly rather than executing them with actual input value. With the impressive progress in constraint solvers, concolic path-based testing tools have literally blossomed up by combining both concrete and symbolic execution, which makes it possible to perform automatic path-based testing on large scale programs. However, these technologies are still suffering from the path explosion problem, since achieving 100\% path coverage is to enumerate all paths between two nodes in a graph, which is well known as a NP-hard problem. To alleviate this path explosion problem and to reduce the computation complexity, different techniques has been proposed, such as pruning search space of symbolic execution, selective symbolic execution and fitness-guided path exploration. In this report, we provide the details on the problem of test data generation and present three techniques to alleviate this path explosion problem. We also discuss the early researchers who contributed to the field of research of test data generation using symbolic execution. \end{abstract}
