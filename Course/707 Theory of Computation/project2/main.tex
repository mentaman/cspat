\begin{abstract}
Symbolic execution is a way to track programs symbolicly rather than executing them with actual input value. With the impressive progress in constraint solvers, concolic path-based testing tools have literally blossomed up by combining both concrete and symbolic execution, which makes it possible to perform automatic path-based testing on large scale programs.
Many DSE tools could be reduced to the constraint generation and constraint solver phases. Context free grammar plays a critical role in language definition and constraint specification. In this report, we give several examples of the usage of context free grammar in helping dynamic symbolic execution like grammar-based whitebox fuzzing, a kind of solver for String constraints called hampi, and symbolic grammar. We also discuss the significant influence of context free grammar upon these testing aspects and the early researchers who contributed.
